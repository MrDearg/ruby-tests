# My Notes

reading through the ruby docs it seems Array#flatten is designed
to take an existing array of multiple levels and flatten those 
contents into a new array at the same root level.
Further research on the Array#compact method removes any value
in an Array of any level that is nil so i chose to first
flatten and then use compact just incase flatten inherited any
nil values during conversion.


# Flatten Array

Take a nested list and return a single flattened list with all values except nil/null.

The challenge is to write a function that accepts an arbitrarily-deep nested list-like structure and returns a flattened structure without any nil/null values.

For Example

input: [1,[2,3,null,4],[null],5]

output: [1,2,3,4,5]

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/ruby).

For running the tests provided, you will need the Minitest gem. Open a
terminal window and run the following command to install minitest:

    gem install minitest

If you would like color output, you can `require 'minitest/pride'` in
the test file, or note the alternative instruction, below, for running
the test file.

Run the tests from the exercise directory using the following command:

    ruby flatten_array_test.rb

To include color from the command line:

    ruby -r minitest/pride flatten_array_test.rb
